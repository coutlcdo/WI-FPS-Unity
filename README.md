# Warehouse Invasion - OSS Unity Game
![Game Gif](https://github.com/coutlcdo/WI-FPS-Unity/blob/main/WI-Gif.gif "Game Gif")

## What is it about
This is a FPS game with rogue-like features that I made to practice what I've learned from the Unity course: [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).

Although it's a finished project I did not polish it that much - and I'm also not planning to do so - because it would've been very time consuming and I prefer to move on by now. That's said, bugs are expect.

## Play the game
Only the [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) build is available, thus you can play it online [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-49946).

## Credits
The **unmodified** game assets are available for free at the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/), in particular,
- The base for the FPS controllers: [Low Poly FPS Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/low-poly-fps-pack-free-sample-144839)
- And the modular scenario: [Snaps Prototype | Sci-Fi / Industrial](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/snaps-prototype-sci-fi-industrial-136759)

Some sounds are also available for free at [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) and [zapsplat.com](https://www.zapsplat.com/).
